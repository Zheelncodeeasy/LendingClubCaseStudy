Lending Club Case Study

## Problem Statment
> You work for a consumer finance company which specializes in lending various 
  types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, 
  the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s 
  profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
 - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in 
   a loss of business to the company
 - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then 
   approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## Objective
> Using EDA, we are required to find out the applicants who have defaulted on their loans.
